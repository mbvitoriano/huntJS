# Hunt JS

Hi there!
This is my very fisrt React-Native App!
This app was made following a course given by [Rocket Seat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), the main functionality is to list a series of "products" (in this case a list of github repositories) based on a api requisiton.
 The items on the API are paginated, so when the user reaches the end of the "page" the app loads the remainig items giving the user the feeling of an infinite scroll.
 
 In my project, i've used [my own API](https://github.com/mbvitoriano/node-api) created with [Node JS](https://github.com/nodejs/node), but to simplify i've used the Rocket Seat's API.

 [Here is the main app code](https://github.com/mbvitoriano/huntJS/tree/master/src/pages)
 
 The APK can be found [here](https://github.com/mbvitoriano/huntJS/blob/master/huntJs.apk)
